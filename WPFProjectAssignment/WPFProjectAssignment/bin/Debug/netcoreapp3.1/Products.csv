001\Draught of Living Death\The Draught of Living Death brings upon its drinker a very powerful sleep that can last indefinitely. This draught is very dangerous if not used with caution...This is an extremely dangerous potion. Brew with maximum caution. The potion is difficult to concoct, since Hermione Granger, a very talented potion-maker, who managed to concoct Polyjuice Potion in her second year, had trouble doing it. Indeed, Horace Slughorn states that only once before in his career was a student (presumably Severus Snape, the Half-Blood Prince whose bookmarked instructions deviated from the potion-making process made a far more effective draught than any other student, though this was never confirmed) able to brew a mostly finished draught in only a single hour. As it is such a difficult potion to brew it is usually safer buying it ready made if in need of it.\150\draughtOfLivingDeath.jpg
002\Elixir of Life\The Elixir of Life will extend the lifespan of those who drink it, and so long as they keep drinking it regularly, they will remain immortal. It is made from the Philosopher’s Stone buy using an immensely difficult incantation known only to a few. The Elixir was also able to restore a disembodied but earthbound soul to full life, creating a body. Indeed, Lord Voldemort, surviving as a lingering spirit due to his Horcruxes planned to steal the Philosopher's Stone to use the Elixir for that purpose, but was thwarted by Harry Potter in 1992.As it is such a powerful potion, we have cast a very strong protection spell on it and it will only be sold to those who have been given specific access to it. No muggle or ordinary wizard would be able to see it in the shop.\120\elixirOfLife.jpg
003\Babbling Beverage\Babbling Beverage is a potion that causes the drinker to talk nonsense. It was first invented as a joke buy a Hogwarts student in the late 1890’s to be used on one of the teachers that had a habit of hexing students that was late to his classes. This joke backfired on the students who have planed it and ended with the teacher accidentally killing one of the students while punishing them. This is why nobody likes to talk about or use the babbling beverage, because of its horrific creation. Severus Snap, long standing potions master at Hogwarts threatens Harry Potter with this potion to let him know that he understood Harry’s message to be about life and death. Fred and George Wesley gave some new life to the potion by incorporate it into their range of “Inappropriately Funny Stuff” that they where selling during the Second Wizarding War.\110\babblingBeverage.jpg
004\Aging Potion\The Ageing Potion is a powerful potion which causes the drinker to temporarily become older. The more of the potion that is drunk, the larger the ageing will occur. This is a popular potion for young witches and wizards to try and get into pubs and order drinks that are age restricted, like fire-whiskey. It was most famously used by Fred and George Wesley during the Triwizard Tournament when they were trying to get past professor Dumbledore’s age-line. But Dumbledore being one of the greatest wizards who ever lived, foresaw this use of the position and the result was most entertaining to see. The Aging potion is to be used cautiously though because if drunk in excess can cause the drinker to age so old that they die from natural causes.\200\agingPotion.jpg
005\Polyjuice Potion\The Polyjuice Potion, which is a complex and time-consuming concoction, is best left to highly skilled witches and wizards. It enables the consumer to assume the physical appearance of another person, as long as they have first procured part of that individual’s body to add to the brew (this may be anything – toenail clippings, dandruff or worse – but it is most usual to use hair). The idea that a witch or wizard might make evil use of parts of the body is an ancient one, and exists in the folklore and superstitions of many cultures. The effect of the potion is only temporary, and depending on how well it has been brewed, may last anything from between ten minutes and twelve hours. You can change age, sex and race by taking the Polyjuice Potion, but not species. Among muggles it is most common that they want to change into celebrities, Brad Pitt is by far the most popular muggle to change into.\300\polyjuicepotion.jpg
006\Shrinking Solution\The Shrinking Solution, also known as the Shrinking Potion, is a potion that causes the drinker to shrink to a smaller form. It is bright green when brewed correctly and, if prepared incorrectly, it can apparently be poisonous. One practical use of this potion is in the transportation of livestock — it allows for a wizard to carry an entire herd of pigs in the pocket. Sometime throughout wizarding history, wizard Samuel Plunkett, who was persecuted by a Muggle village, poured Shrinking Solution down the village well and terrorised the shrunken villagers by chasing them around in hobnail boots. Be aware when using this potion, not to shrink yourself so small that your cat might eat you.\130\shrinkingSolution.png
007\Skele-Gro Potion\Skele-Gro (alternately spelled Skelegro) is a dreadfully tasting potion which restores bones. It is able to mend broken bones, or even regrow entire bones that have vanished or been otherwise lost. For regrowing entire bones, the process is very slow and painful, and it can take over a full day. Madame Pomphrey, the matron at Hogwarts has only given this potion to students a handful times. She prefers to use her healing magic to mend broken bones and fractures, but when Guilderoy Lockhart vanished all the bones in Harry Potters arm, she was not impressed because in her own words “I can mend bones in a second, but making them grow back!...”\75\skeleGroPotion.jpg
008\Strengthening Solution\The Strengthening Solution will come to good use if you are preparing for a fight. If drunk in good time it will give you both more physical strength and increase your magical ability. It is brewed in at least two stages, requiring several days to mature in between, and two of the ingredients used to make it are salamander blood, and powdered Griffin claw. It was one of the potions that the Ministry Of Magic banned from the teachings of Hogwarts school during the short rain of Dolores Umbridge as Headmistress. It was widely believed at the time that dumbledore was trying to mobilise the students in an army against the Ministry to seize power, before Umbridge took over.(not for sale to under 17's)\150\strengtheningsolution.jpg
009\Wolfsbane Potion\This potion was invented in the early 90's and it helps werewolves to keep their human mind when transforming at the full moon. The potion must be drunk everyday for the full week leading up to the fullmoon or else it will not work. It tastes disgusting and unfortunately sugar makes it useless.\50\wolfsbanepotion.jpg
